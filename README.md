# RAVEN MDC Dataset

The RAVEN Mock Data Challenge (MDC) dataset is a large, simulated population of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events generated to test and develop low-latency multi-messenger follow-up pipelines. Each row represents one synthetic gravitational-wave event with parameters drawn from astrophysically motivated distributions, including component masses, spins, luminosity distance, redshift, inclination angle, sky position (RA/Dec), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These simulations mimic what LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA would observe during real operations and provide a realistic environment for building and validating tools like RAVEN, which identifies potential coincidences between gravitational-wave alerts and high-energy transients (e.g., GRBs).
